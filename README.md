# Walmart Inventory Optimization & Sales Forecasting (Power BI)

This repository contains a Power BI project that analyzes Walmart’s inventory efficiency, sales performance, and forecast behavior across 45 stores. The goal is to identify inefficiencies in inventory management and highlight opportunities to reduce holding costs while improving sales alignment.

## 📌 Business Problem

Retailers often struggle with balancing inventory levels against actual demand.  
Excess inventory increases holding costs, ties up working capital, and can lead to markdown losses. On the other hand, under-stocking leads to missed sales and stockouts.

This dashboard helps answer:

- Are we holding too much inventory relative to sales?
- Which stores are most inefficient?
- Where is safety stock misaligned with actual demand?
- How have costs and sales trended over time?

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Inventory Inefficiency:** Holding costs are growing faster than sales, suggesting excess stock accumulation.
2. **Store Imbalance:** A small subset of stores contributes disproportionately to total holding costs and lower efficiency.
3. **Safety Stock Misalignment:** High safety stock does not consistently correlate with higher weekly sales.
4. **Growth Patterns:** Cost growth under inflationary conditions demonstrates pressure on margins.
