## 📌 Business Problem

Retail businesses struggle to balance inventory levels with actual demand. Excess inventory increases **holding costs and cash tied up**, while inadequate stock leads to **missed sales opportunities**. Walmart’s operations require better insights into:

- Inventory cost relative to sales performance
- Store-level operational inefficiency
- Safety stock effectiveness
- Cost trends under inflationary pressures

This dashboard answers key strategic questions to support **data-driven inventory optimization**.
